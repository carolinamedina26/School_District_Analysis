# Overview
The State Board of Education has provided us with data to analyze the math and reading proficiency across multiple schools, as well as, other insides such as budget, school size and scores and its relationship to the overall grades. Also, they have requested a data cleansing since there was a mistake on a specific school and grade.

# Results 
## Effects of the changes 
The overall summary of the schools did not change since we performed the data cleansing only to the requested data points. Since there was a mistake on the 9th grades scores on Thomas Hight School, we proceed to change their math and reading grades to NaN, and preform the analysis again, these changes on the data set changed the results of Thomas High School only. 

## Changes to Thom High School

  1) **the average math score** decreased from 83.41 to 83.35, meaning a 0.06 change. 
  2) **the average reading score** increase from 83.84 to 83.89, meaning a 0.05 change.
  3) **the percentage of passing math** decreased from 93.27% to 93.18%, meaning a 0.09% change. 
  4) **The average of passing reading** decreased from 97.30% to 97.01%, meaning a 0.29% change. 
  5) **The Overall Passing** decreased from 90.94% to 90.63%, all these changes represent an overall change of 0.31% 
  
  **The Total school budget and budget per student did not change**, because the correct math and reading scores does not affect the results of these two variables.
